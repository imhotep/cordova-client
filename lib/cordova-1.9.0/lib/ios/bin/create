# I've tried to be thorough in my documentation of the manual actions below...
# on first brush it would seem that the right solution would be to brute force
# recurse the directory tree renaming instances of __ID__ and __TESTING__ ...however this is a little blunt
# and while so the below is too being very manual it was/is easier to test, fucking manually, and sort out the automation

# rename the folders/files:
#
# - ./__TESTING__.xcodeproj/
# - ./__TESTING__/
# - ./__TESTING__/__TESTING__-info.plist
# - ./__TESTING__/__TESTING__-Prefix.plist
mv $PROJECT_PATH/__TESTING__.xcodeproj $PROJECT_PATH/$ACTIVITY.xcodeproj
mv $PROJECT_PATH/__TESTING__ $PROJECT_PATH/$ACTIVITY
mv $PROJECT_PATH/$ACTIVITY/__TESTING__-info.plist $PROJECT_PATH/$ACTIVITY/$ACTIVITY-info.plist
mv $PROJECT_PATH/$ACTIVITY/__TESTING__-Prefix.pch $PROJECT_PATH/$ACTIVITY/$ACTIVITY-Prefix.pch

# lets store a reference to the root
R=$PROJECT_PATH/$ACTIVITY

# replace __TESTING__ and --ID-- with ACTIVITY and ID strings, respectively, in:
#
# - ./__TESTING__.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
# - ./__TESTING__/Classes/AppDelegate.h
# - ./__TESTING__/Classes/AppDelegate.m
# - ./__TESTING__/Resources/main.m
# - ./__TESTING__/Resources/__TESTING__-info.plist
